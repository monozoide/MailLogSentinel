# Contributing to MailLogSentinel

We welcome contributions to MailLogSentinel! Whether you're interested in fixing bugs, adding new features, improving documentation, or sharing ideas, your help is appreciated.

## How to Contribute

This project follows a simple contribution workflow:

1.  **Fork the Repository:**
    Start by forking the [MailLogSentinel GitHub repository](https://github.com/monozoide/MailLogSentinel) to your own GitHub account.

2.  **Create a Branch:**
    Create a new branch in your forked repository for your changes. Choose a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/add-new-report-format` or `bugfix/resolve-parsing-error`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-new-feature
    ```

3.  **Make Your Changes:**
    Implement your feature, bug fix, or documentation update.
    *   **Code:** If you're writing code, try to follow the existing coding style. Add comments where necessary.
    *   **Documentation:** For documentation changes, ensure clarity and accuracy.
    *   **Tests:** If you're adding a new feature or fixing a bug, consider adding unit tests to cover your changes. (This is an area for future growth in the project).

4.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add feature: Describe your new feature"
    ```
    Or for a bug fix:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Fix: Describe the bug and your solution"
    ```

5.  **Push to Your Fork:**
    Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-new-feature
    ```

6.  **Open a Pull Request:**
    Go to the original MailLogSentinel repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request (PR) from your forked branch to the `main` branch of the MailLogSentinel repository.
    *   Provide a clear title and description for your PR, explaining the purpose and nature of your changes.
    *   If your PR addresses an existing issue, reference it in the description (e.g., "Closes #123").

## Coding Guidelines (General)

While there aren't strict, formalized coding guidelines at this stage, please try to:

*   Write clear, readable Python code.
*   Follow PEP 8 conventions where practical.
*   Comment your code, especially complex parts or non-obvious logic.
*   Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.
*   If adding new dependencies, justify their need.

## Reporting Bugs
